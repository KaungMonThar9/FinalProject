<h1 align="center">MJJ Craft: A 2D Block MiniQuest Adventure</h1>

# Overview
This project combines Java Swing with Object Oriented Programming to bring about a nostalgic return to classic platformer games, such as Terraria and Super Mario Brothers. Players are spawned into a gorgeous block world where they collect fallen stars to advance through each level. When every single level is beat, the player is greeted with a Game Won Screen filled with collectible fallen stars, or if the player loses all their lives, a Game Over Screen instead. Have fun playing!

**Gameplay**
- Left and Right arrow keys for left and right movement
- Up arrow key to trigger a jump, and the Down arrow key to collect a fallen star
- Avoid the constantly moving enemies, with each hit taking away a life (You only get 3 lives!)
- Collect all the fallen stars on the screen for each level and beat the game!

**Polished Visual Imagery and Sound Effects**
- The player, platform, enemy sprites were all selected to match with the color palette and theme of the game
- Background art (Home Page, Levels, Game Over Screens) was carefully chosen to seamlessly integrate with the atmosphere and concept
- Sound effects were meticulously picked to aid in providing the most enjoyable player experience

**Realistic and Fun Game Mechanics**
- Gravity implemented to provide the player with a more immersive and realistic experience
- Moving platforms, accelerating enemy speeds for a more challenging yet addictive gameplay
- Player input are handled with virtually zero latency, contributing to an overall seamless and entertaining game environment 

**Abstraction and Design Principles**
- Abstract classes and inheritance was properly utilized to ensure efficient and readable code design
- Each class had a primary role that was easily distinguishable and understandable
- Javadocs provided to further improve readability
